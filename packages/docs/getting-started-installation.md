## Prerequisites

Serverlize requires at least Node v8 or greater, and [Yarn]() is highly recommended for dependency management.

## Cloning the repo

Serverlize is just a fancy wrapper around Serverless, so if you're familiar with it this should be a cakewalk.

The easiest way to get started is to clone `serverlize-starter` as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/serverlize/serverlize-starter
$ cd serverlize-starter
$ yarn
```

> MAYBE MAKE A `create-serverlize-app`

Once inside the project, you should have a folder structure as follows:

> Copy output of `tree`
