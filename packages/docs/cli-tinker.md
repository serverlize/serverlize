Serverlize provides a convenient REPL environment to interact with an application on the command line. To begin, type the following command from a project root:

```bash
$ slz tinker
```

You should see the following:

>  INSERT IMAGE OF TS-NODE RUNNING

From here, any snippet of code can be imported and run interactively.

> INSERT IMAGE OF RESULT OF `Pets.get()`
