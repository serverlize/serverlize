title: Preface

At Endemol Shine Group, we write a lot of TypeScript for both client and
server-side projects. We also adopted Serverless architectures quite early
on, and have first-hand experienced many of the pain points in developing truly
"serverless" applications.

With that said, we are witnesses of the advantages offered by such architectures
and ...

## What Serverlize does

Our aim was to build applications that observed all five pillars of the AWS
Well-Architected Framework:

- Operational Excellence
- Security
- Reliability
- Performance Efficiency
- Cost Optimization

## Why we built Serverlize

> Small teams in particular should find productivity boosts.
> Aimed at increasing developer productivity
> We wanted to build a framework that allows us to quickly set up projects that are set up for scalability from day one.

As a small team, we didn't want to spend time reinventing the wheel for each
project. We wanted a solution that would maximise our productivity whilst also
not compromising on aspects such as security and operational reliability.

We wanted to be able to deliver high-quality projects that incorporated best
practices and secure defaults wherever possible, freeing up valuable developer
time to focus on business requirements.

## How Serverlize is different from other frameworks

We believe Serverlize is very different from the majority of contemporary
serverless frameworks. Almost all are focused on transforming some sort of
intermediate format into CloudFormation snippets. Many people even use these
frameworks to manage other AWS resources that aren't even necessarily part of
their serverless stack.

> Bringing new meaning to the phrase "infrastructure-as-code"

Serverlize aims to bring new meaning to the phrase 'infrastructure-as-code' by
providing high-quality components that developers can use to build their
application alongside the stack.

The end result is a remarkably simple, concise and scalable approach to
building cloud applications on AWS.

Above all, it’s a toolkit for small teams who want to compete on fidelity and
reach with much larger teams using more laborious, mainstream approaches.

Give it a go, let us know what you think,
