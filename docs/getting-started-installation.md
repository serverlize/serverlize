## Prerequisites

Serverlize requires at least Node v8 or greater, and [Yarn][link-yarn] is 
highly recommended for dependency management.

## Cloning the repo

Serverlize is just a fancy wrapper around Serverless, so if you're familiar 
with it this should be a cakewalk.

The easiest way to get started is to clone `serverlize-starter` as follows:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/serverlize/serverlize-starter
$ cd serverlize-starter
$ yarn
```

[link-yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/
