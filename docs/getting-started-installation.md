## Prerequisites

Serverlize requires at least Node v8 or greater, and [Yarn][link-yarn] is 
highly recommended for dependency management.

## Creating a project

The easiest way to get started is as follows:

```bash
$ yarn create @serverlize/app my-app
```

[link-yarn]: https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/
