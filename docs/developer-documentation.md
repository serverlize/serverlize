It is important to keep documentation consistent for a unified experience.

This document describes the tone-of-voice to use when writing documentation.


Never use 'I' or 'you', always use 'we'.

Avoid 'dumbing-down' technical terminology, explain or link to external resources where necessary.

### Empowerment

| Write like this… | Not like this… | Why? |
|---|---|---|
| "When creating a function, ask yourself if you've done everything necessary" | "Warning: You must select all appropriate options. Failure to do so will result in failure" | Our mandate is to assist developers in achieving their goals. The process should feel inviting, not threatening. |
