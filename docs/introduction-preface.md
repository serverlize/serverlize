At Endemol Shine Group, we almost exclusively write TypeScript for our
Serverless projects. However, being an early adopter comes with its' fair
share of pain points, and

We wanted to bring together best-of-breed tooling under one project and allow
developers to reap the benefits.

We also adopted Serverless architectures quite early on,
and have first-hand experienced many of the pain points in developing truly
"serverless" applications.

With that said, we are witnesses of the advantages offered by such architectures
and ...

## Guiding principles

> Make it easy to do the right thing

> Focus on the solution, not the implementation

> Take advantage of Typescript for more rigorous code

## What Serverlize does

Our aim was to build applications that observed all [five pillars of the AWS
Well-Architected Framework][link-well-architected-framework] in the context of
[Serverless applications][link-well-architected-framework-serverless].

### Operational Excellence

This involves topics such as

### Security

We want our applications to protect data as well as our systems. This involves
things such as encrypting credentials and data.


### Reliability

Reliability is somewhat inherent to the Serverless paradigm, in that

### Performance Efficiency

### Cost Optimization

> @TODO Could we hook into the pricing API and try and calculate a rough usage price?

## Why we built Serverlize

> Small teams in particular should find productivity boosts.

> Aimed at increasing developer productivity

> We wanted to build a framework that allows us to quickly set up projects that are set up for scalability from day one.

As a small team, we didn't want to spend time reinventing the wheel for each
project. We wanted a solution that would maximise our productivity whilst also
not compromising on aspects such as security and operational reliability.

We wanted to be able to deliver high-quality projects that incorporated best
practices and secure defaults wherever possible, freeing up valuable developer
time to focus on business requirements.

## How Serverlize is different from other frameworks

We believe Serverlize is very different from the majority of contemporary
serverless frameworks. in that it is focused on bridging the gap between
code and infrastructure.

> Bringing new meaning to the phrase "infrastructure-as-code"

Serverlize aims to bring new meaning to the phrase 'infrastructure-as-code' by
providing high-quality components that developers can use to build their
application alongside the stack.

The end result is a remarkably simple, concise and scalable approach to
building cloud applications on AWS.

Above all, it’s a toolkit for small teams who want to compete on fidelity and
reach with much larger teams by doing more with less.
